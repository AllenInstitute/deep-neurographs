<b> NeuronProofreader</b> is a Python library for automated proofreading of neuron reconstructions. It corrects both <b>split</b>  (over-fragmented neurons) and <b>merge</b>  (erroneously joined neurons) errors in large-scale connectomics datasets. The library processes neuron fragments in SWC format using a multimodal pipeline that identifies and corrects topological errors in whole-brain reconstructions.

## Overview

The neuron fragment split correction pipeline consists of three main steps:

<blockquote>
  <p>a. <strong>Graph Construction</strong>: Reads neuron fragments stored as SWC files and loads them into a Networkx graph.</p>
  <p>b. <strong>Proposal Generation</strong>: Generates potential connections between nearby fragments.</p>
  <p>c. <strong>GNN-Based Inference</strong>: Predicts whether to accept or reject proposals based on the geometric and image-based features.</p>
</blockquote>
