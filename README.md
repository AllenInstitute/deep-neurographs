## Usage
 - To use this template, click the green `Use this template` button and `Create new repository`.
 - After github initially creates the new repository, please wait an extra minute for the initialization scripts to finish organizing the repo.
 - To enable the automatic semantic version increments: in the repository go to `Settings` and `Collaborators and teams`. Click the green `Add people` button. Add `svc-aindscicomp` as an admin. Modify the file in `.github/workflows/tag_and_publish.yml` and remove the if statement in line 10. The semantic version will now be incremented every time a code is committed into the main branch.
 - To publish to PyPI, enable semantic versioning and uncomment the publish block in `.github/workflows/tag_and_publish.yml`. The code will now be published to PyPI every time the code is committed into the main branch.
 - The `.github/workflows/test_and_lint.yml` file will run automated tests and style checks every time a Pull Request is opened. If the checks are undesired, the `test_and_lint.yml` can be deleted. The strictness of the code coverage level, etc., can be modified by altering the configurations in the `pyproject.toml` file and the `.flake8` file.

## Installation
To use the software, in the root directory, run
```bash
pip install -e .
```

To develop the code, run
```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
```

### Linters and testing

There are several libraries used to run linters, check documentation, and run tests.

- Please test your changes using the **coverage** library, which will run the tests and log a coverage report:

```bash
coverage run -m unittest discover && coverage report
```

- Use **interrogate** to check that modules, methods, etc. have been documented thoroughly:

```bash
interrogate .
```

- Use **flake8** to check that code is up to standards (no unused imports, etc.):
```bash
flake8 .
```

- Use **black** to automatically format the code into PEP standards:
```bash
black .
```

- Use **isort** to automatically sort import statements:
```bash
isort .
```

### Pull requests

For internal members, please create a branch. For external members, please fork the repository and open a pull request from the fork. We'll primarily use [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit) style for commit messages. Roughly, they should follow the pattern:
```text
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>
```

where scope (optional) describes the packages affected by the code changes and type (mandatory) is one of:

- **build**: Changes that affect build tools or external dependencies (example scopes: pyproject.toml, setup.py)
- **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (examples: .github/workflows/ci.yml)
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bugfix
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

### Semantic Release

The table below, from [semantic release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release), shows which commit message gets you which release type when `semantic-release` runs (using the default configuration):

| Commit message                                                                                                                                                                                   | Release type                                                                                                    |

### Documentation
To generate the rst files source files for documentation, run
```bash
sphinx-apidoc -o doc_template/source/ src 
```
Then to create the documentation HTML files, run
```bash
sphinx-build -b html doc_template/source/ doc_template/build/html
```
More info on sphinx installation can be found [here](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/installation.html).
