This module defines a set of configuration classes used for setting up various
aspects of a system involving graphs, proposals, and machine learning (ML).

@dataclass
class GraphConfig:
    """
    Represents configuration settings related to graph properties and
    proposals generated.

    Attributes
    ----------
    anisotropy : Tuple[float], optional
        Scaling factors applied to xyz coordinates to account for anisotropy
        of microscope. Note this instance of "anisotropy" is only used while
        reading SWC files. Default is (1.0, 1.0, 1.0).
    complex_bool : bool
        Indication of whether to generate complex proposals, meaning proposals
        between leaf and non-leaf nodes. Default is False.
    img_bbox : dict, optional
        Dictionary with the keys "min" and "max" which specify a bounding box
        in an image. Default is None.
    long_range_bool : bool, optional
        Indication of whether to generate simple proposals within a scaled
        distance of "search_radius" from leaves without any proposals. Default
        is False.
    min_size : float, optional
        Minimum path length (in microns) of swc files which are stored as
        connected components in the FragmentsGraph. Default is 30.
    min_size_with_proposals : float, optional
        Minimum fragment path length required for proposals. Default is 0.
    node_spacing : int, optional
        Spacing (in microns) between nodes. Default is 2.
    proposals_per_leaf : int
        Maximum number of proposals generated for each leaf. Default is 3.
    prune_depth : int, optional
        Branches in graph less than "prune_depth" microns are pruned. Default
        is 16.
    remove_doubles : bool, optional
        ...
    remove_high_risk_merges : bool, optional
        Indication of whether to remove high risk merge sites (i.e. close
        branching points). Default is False.
    smooth_bool : bool, optional
        Indication of whether to smooth branches in the graph. Default is
        True.
    trim_endpoints_bool : bool, optional
        Indication of whether to endpoints of branches with exactly one
        proposal. Default is True.
